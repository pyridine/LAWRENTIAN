Jan13: First Use-Case diagram presentation.

==Team 1==
Actors are roles; they are not hierarchical.

Use-Case diagram arrow directions do not matter. In Use-Case diagram there is NO need to keep all the primary actors are to the left and supporting actors to the right.

Brief Use case:
1) Needs primary actor
2) Needs goal
3) Needs supporting actors to accomplish its goal

Make sure the primary actors are explicitly stated in the use case.

Actor - verb - object syntax so: <This Person> is responsible for doing <this to this>.

Make sure the Use-Cases are in the slide in entirity.

Everytime there is a Use-Case make sure these are answered: 1) What's the goal? 2) Who's got it?

==Team 2==
Make sure each actor is sufficiently described in the Use-Case: adjectives and number are important.

Having a meaningfull name for actors which is very-specific is highly important.

Just a thought: use color-coding on lines in SuD to distinguish overlap.

==Team 3==
Don't make Use-Cases too hierarchical just to have the sequential info.

Good to explicitly specify when the trigger for the Use-Case is specified.
